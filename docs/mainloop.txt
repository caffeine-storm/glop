It's not entirely clear from a cursory reading exactly what the expected/desired control flow is with respect to the stages of producing each frame. Here's a high-level description of what we'd expect.

- each frame (haunts/main.go)
	- sys.Think()
		- os.Think()
			- drain X event queue
		- os.GetInputEvents()
			- input-event buffer-swap
		- input.Think(horizon-sys.start_ms, events)
			- foreach 'event'
				- notify mouse listeners as needed
				- 'input.PressKey' and its baggage
					- call Key.SetPressAmt
						- calls Key.SetPressAmt
						- generates gin.Event 'consequences'
					- finding releated keys
						- input.PressKey them too
				- notify input listeners about all the 'consequence' events
					- listener.HandleEventGroup
						- !!! gui.Gui is a listener
							- foreach widget in tree
								- Respond()/DoRespond()
			
			- foreach key
				- key.Think() (bool, float) --> need to press me with 'amount'
					- input.pressKey(key, amt, no-cause, new-event-group)
					- notify input listeners about all non-empty groups
						- listener.HandleEventGroup
							- !!! gui.Gui is a listener
								- foreach widget in tree
									- Respond()/DoRespond()

			- foreach listener
				- listener.Think()
					- !!! gui.Gui is a listener

	- ui.Think()
		- !!! gui.Gui is the 'ui'
			- WE _JUST_ HAD A THINK AT THE END OF input.Think() T_T
		- foreach widget in tree-of-widgets
			- Think()/DoThink()
	- ui.Draw() [on-the-render-thread]
		--> gui.Widgets get to Draw()
