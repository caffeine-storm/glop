tmckee:#35 need a way to target distinct rejection files if two tests want to
re-use an expected file

tmckee:#34 rendertest.DrawRectNdc is sensitive to whether gl.TEXTURE_2D is
enabled or not; we should make it work regardless and reset any gl state it
modifies.

tmckee:#29 shouldn't we be subtracting 'sys.start_ms' from the 'horizon' in system.System.Think() ?

tmckee:#28 text_edit_line.go is checking for a click but only checking the x
co-ordinate... would clicking below the box move the cursor??? need to test!

tmckee:#25 our timestamp code is scuffed in glop.cpp

tmckee:#24 gui.TextLine.next_text is never used; but is needed for detecting change-in-text in gui.TextEditLine

tmckee:#23 for X, we need to listen for MappingNotify events and
XRefreshKeyboardMapping() as needed
https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/utilities/keyboard/XRefreshKeyboardMapping.html

tmckee:#22 clicking the 'x' button on a window doesn't close it r.n. We need to
detect a "close message" or smth in glop.cpp.

tmckee:#15 refactor: move ShouldContainLog from render/rendertest/cmp_test.go to gloptest/

tmckee:#14 imgmanip/scale.go should sample neighbouring points when scaling by
non-integral amounts

tmckee:#13 sprite/sheet.go calls glu.Build2DMipmaps and passes 'gl.INT' as the
'type' parameter. But it _should_ be a 'gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE' because the data is
coming from an image.RGBA which uses one byte per component.

tmckee:#12 gui tests are flaky when not running under xvfb

tmckee:#7 installed multilib support to get the build going; is it necessary?
- sudo apt install gcc-multilib g++-multilib
- can check what's needed to build from inside a fresh ubuntu docker container

----

tmckee:#3 port Haunts' "make update-appveyor-image" helper to glop

tmckee:#4 we need to change Dictionary to use 'constant' geometry and support positioning by offset through shader-uniform-variables.

----

tmckee:#5 opengl deprecated/removed GL_QUADS; we'll need to migrate away from
gl.QUADS

tmckee:#8 use type system to make initialization ordering constraints explicit
	- need to identify which modules/packages need this

tmckee:#10 in gos/linux/glop.cpp:
	case XK_slash: ki = '/'; break;
	case XK_space: ki = '/'; break;
	?? shouldn't that be a space, not a slash?

If windows is ok with giving up the main thread we should switch to doing
things with a Run() / Quit() mechanism instead of a for { Think() } mechanism.
Doing this would increase the number of mouse events on osx and would give
better resolution in the event of a long frame.

Make a way to test sprite stuff without needed opengl.
