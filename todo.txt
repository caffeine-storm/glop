tmckee: in gos/cgo_linux.go, mouse position needs to get un-stubbed

tmckee: installed multilib support to get the build going; is it necessary?
- sudo apt install gcc-multilib g++-multilib

tmckee: use type system to make initialization ordering constraints explicit

tmckee: find a better debug-logging sol'n than println

tmckee: use a xvfb instance for rendering tests

tmckee: Make it so that 'go test ./...' builds the native library on-demand

tmckee: find a way to work around needing LD_LIBRARY_PATH when running tests in
subdirectories

If windows is ok with giving up the main thread we should switch to doing
things with a Run() / Quit() mechanism instead of a for { Think() } mechanism.
Doing this would increase the number of mouse events on osx and would give
better resolution in the event of a long frame.

Make a way to test sprite stuff without needed opengl.
