tmckee:#16 consider adding a Makefile recipe to generate a compile_commands.json file for the C++ code. Something like `go build -a -toolexec 'bear --' ./...`

tmckee:#15 refactor: move ShouldContainLog from render/rendertest/cmp_test.go to gloptest/

tmckee:#14 imgmanip/scale.go should sample neighbouring points when scaling by
non-integral amounts

tmckee:#13 sprite/sheet.go calls glu.Build2DMipmaps and passes 'gl.INT' as the
'type' parameter. But it _should_ be a 'gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE' because the data is
coming from an image.RGBA which uses one byte per component.

tmckee:#12 gui tests are flaky when not running under xvfb

tmckee:#11 getting incorrect source line/number attribution when logging in Haunts
-	might have something to do with different callstack depth during "Trace" vs.
	"Debug", etc.

tmckee:#7 installed multilib support to get the build going; is it necessary?
- sudo apt install gcc-multilib g++-multilib
- can check what's needed to build from inside a fresh ubuntu docker container

tmckee#1: clean up after big 'green' step
	- text height aribirarily chosen as 12 in TextLine.coreDraw
	- text Justification aribirarily chosen as Left in TextLine.coreDraw

----

tmckee#3: port Haunts' "make update-appveyor-image" helper to glop

tmckee#4: we need to change Dictionary to use 'constant' geometry and support positioning by offset through shader-uniform-variables.

----

tmckee#5: opengl deprecated/removed GL_QUADS; we'll need to migrate away from
gl.QUADS

tmckee:#6 in gos/cgo_linux.go, mouse position needs to get un-stubbed

tmckee:#8 use type system to make initialization ordering constraints explicit
	- need to identify which modules/packages need this

tmckee:#10 in gos/linux/glop.cpp:
	case XK_slash: ki = '/'; break;
	case XK_space: ki = '/'; break;
	?? shouldn't that be a space, not a slash?

If windows is ok with giving up the main thread we should switch to doing
things with a Run() / Quit() mechanism instead of a for { Think() } mechanism.
Doing this would increase the number of mouse events on osx and would give
better resolution in the event of a long frame.

Make a way to test sprite stuff without needed opengl.

next bug: #17
