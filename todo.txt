tmckee: 'make test' can leave some temporary files behind on success; see
sprite/test_sprite/<hash>.gob when running sprite spec tests
	- needs controlled cacheing of pixel data when loading sprite sheets
	- needs cacheing at sprite.Manager level

tmckee: make a commit hook that blocks non-fmt'd changes

tmckee: migrate to convey
(https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/convey) instead of gospec

tmckee: I've been wrapping errors with 'fmt.Errorf( ... %v ... )' but should be
				using '%w'.

tmckee: make render.RenderQueueInterface.Queue take a specific type of
'RenderWork'; will let us refactor to inject the GL dependecy down the line.

tmckee: loading a gui.Dictionary from disk should not need a render queue

tmckee: in gos/cgo_linux.go, mouse position needs to get un-stubbed

tmckee: installed multilib support to get the build going; is it necessary?
- sudo apt install gcc-multilib g++-multilib

tmckee: use type system to make initialization ordering constraints explicit
	- need to identify which modules/packages need this

tmckee: find a better debug-logging sol'n than println
	- it's slog

tmckee: Make it so that 'go test ./...' builds the native library on-demand

tmckee: find a way to work around needing LD_LIBRARY_PATH when running tests in
subdirectories

tmckee: in gos/linux/glop.cpp:
	case XK_slash: ki = '/'; break;
	case XK_space: ki = '/'; break;
	?? shouldn't that be a space, not a slash?

If windows is ok with giving up the main thread we should switch to doing
things with a Run() / Quit() mechanism instead of a for { Think() } mechanism.
Doing this would increase the number of mouse events on osx and would give
better resolution in the event of a long frame.

Make a way to test sprite stuff without needed opengl.
