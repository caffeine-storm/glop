tmckee: make ByteBank interface take a single key instead of a pair of keys

tmckee: 'make test' can leave some temporary files behind on success; see
sprite/test_sprite/<hash>.gob when running sprite spec tests

tmckee: I've been wrapping errors with 'fmt.Errorf( ... %v ... )' but should be
				using '%w'.

tmckee: in gos/cgo_linux.go, mouse position needs to get un-stubbed

tmckee: installed multilib support to get the build going; is it necessary?
- sudo apt install gcc-multilib g++-multilib

tmckee: use type system to make initialization ordering constraints explicit

tmckee: find a better debug-logging sol'n than println

tmckee: Make it so that 'go test ./...' builds the native library on-demand

tmckee: find a way to work around needing LD_LIBRARY_PATH when running tests in
subdirectories

tmckee: in gos/linux/glop.cpp:
    case XK_slash: ki = '/'; break;
    case XK_space: ki = '/'; break;
  ?? shouldn't that be a space, not a slash?

If windows is ok with giving up the main thread we should switch to doing
things with a Run() / Quit() mechanism instead of a for { Think() } mechanism.
Doing this would increase the number of mouse events on osx and would give
better resolution in the event of a long frame.

Make a way to test sprite stuff without needed opengl.
