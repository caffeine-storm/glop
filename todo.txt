tmckee: clean up after big 'green' step
	- TextEditLine needs rendertests
	- 'screen shot'ing returns a slice of bytes but it's confusing about what
	  layout/invariants apply
	- un-stub gui.go's Make function
		- needs a way to load a font but no render queue is present
	- storing the render queue's shaderBank alongside a Dictionary in a
	  module-level variable is the barfness
		- would have to teach widgets how to look up such things...
	- text height aribirarily chosen as 12 in TextLine.coreDraw
	- text Justification aribirarily chosen as Left in TextLine.coreDraw
	- having to remember to call gui.Init before rendering any text is a foot-gun
	- gui.AddDictForTest is not what we want

tmckee: make Dictionary.RenderString render w.r.t. the top of the bounding box

----

tmckee: add tests for gui.TextEditLine

----

tmckee: opengl deprecated/removed GL_QUADS; we'll need to migrate away from
gl.QUADS

tmckee: in gos/cgo_linux.go, mouse position needs to get un-stubbed

tmckee: installed multilib support to get the build going; is it necessary?
- sudo apt install gcc-multilib g++-multilib

tmckee: use type system to make initialization ordering constraints explicit
	- need to identify which modules/packages need this

tmckee: find a way to work around needing LD_LIBRARY_PATH when running tests in
subdirectories

tmckee: in gos/linux/glop.cpp:
	case XK_slash: ki = '/'; break;
	case XK_space: ki = '/'; break;
	?? shouldn't that be a space, not a slash?

If windows is ok with giving up the main thread we should switch to doing
things with a Run() / Quit() mechanism instead of a for { Think() } mechanism.
Doing this would increase the number of mouse events on osx and would give
better resolution in the event of a long frame.

Make a way to test sprite stuff without needed opengl.
