tmckee: our render tests have upside down expected files because of how we readPixels and write the .pgm files. We should not have flipped expectations.

tmckee: opengl deprecated/removed GL_QUADS; we'll need to migrate away from
gl.QUADS

tmckee: make render.RenderQueueInterface.Queue take a specific type of
'RenderJob'; will let us refactor to inject the GL dependecy down the line.

tmckee: in gos/cgo_linux.go, mouse position needs to get un-stubbed

tmckee: installed multilib support to get the build going; is it necessary?
- sudo apt install gcc-multilib g++-multilib

tmckee: use type system to make initialization ordering constraints explicit
	- need to identify which modules/packages need this

tmckee: Make it so that 'go test ./...' builds the native library on-demand

tmckee: find a way to work around needing LD_LIBRARY_PATH when running tests in
subdirectories

tmckee: in gos/linux/glop.cpp:
	case XK_slash: ki = '/'; break;
	case XK_space: ki = '/'; break;
	?? shouldn't that be a space, not a slash?

If windows is ok with giving up the main thread we should switch to doing
things with a Run() / Quit() mechanism instead of a for { Think() } mechanism.
Doing this would increase the number of mouse events on osx and would give
better resolution in the event of a long frame.

Make a way to test sprite stuff without needed opengl.
